# Bench-and-Memorial-Project
**Community members** - who want to know more about donated memorials around the city.

**Trackers** – the people who physically mark these memorials.  

**Clerks** – Accept/Put on Hold/Delete incoming memorials sent from the tracker.

**Admins** – Directors of the project who will keep the website functional and add and delete accounts.

A tracker from the City of Edwardsville will go out and locate a memorial in Edwardsville and fill out a Tagger Form.

The tracker will then, record details specific to this type of memorial, then send it back to a Clerk position, so they can Accept/Put On Hole/Delete a new memorial to the database. This will then add a new memorial to the website, where community members will be able to search for memorials.
